                        When Immigration Corp sends you a visa approval letter, it is important that you confirm that all of the visas you need for your travel have been obtained, that visas for each country you intend to visit are valid for the dates of arrival and departure from the country/region of your visit as well as for the reason and nature of your visit (tourism, business, etc.). You must notify Immigration Corp immediately by email if you identify any discrepancy in your documentation.

                        The issue of a visa depends exclusively on the issuing authority and immigration officials in each country have the final decision to admit entry into the country or region, even when all of the stipulated requirements have been met. Immigration Corp does not guarantee that the issuing authority will issue the visa in a timely manner and within the specified time frame; therefore, Immigration Corp fees will be collected for the completion of procedures required for this issue. We advise you that non-refundable fares or reservations must not be purchased until all visas have been obtained.

                        The fees for our services shall be specified on the website. Other charges and fees charged by an issuing authority or any courier or delivery service must be paid by you.
                        You shall pay for all bank charges, exchange rate differences, currency adjustments, transaction fee and other such charges incurred by your bank or financial institution(s) throughout the payment process.
                        Please check all your information on the online application form before submitting. An extra fee will be charged if you want to change any information related to your application form online you submitted before.
                        If your visas or consular services (like 5-year visa exemption, Passport, etc.) are denied by the related Competent Authority, depending on each case, you can receive a partial or full refund. In this situation, we will inform you of the refunded fee(s) in detail via your registered email.
                        Once Immigration Corp submits a travel document request to an issuing authority on your behalf, the government fees are non-refundable.
                        All fees paid to an issuing authority by Immigration Corp on your behalf are non-refundable. In the event that a visa or passport or 5-year visa exemption application is submitted on your behalf and the request is rejected for any reason, we will, at your request, make an additional attempt to secure the travel document. Our additional service fees will not be assessed in this situation but you will be required to pay any additional fees assessed by the issuing authority.
                        Admin fees/ Government fee and the availability of services are subject to change without notice. Fees and services may differ between the time when the order is placed and when the order is completed. When possible, Immigration Corp will try to inform the client of mentioned changes. We reserve the right to choose the most appropriate service available given the time limits that the client has specified.
                        Orders which are not submitted via the online application form, according to the order process, may be charged an additional administrative fee if so specified on the Website. Immigration Corp reserves the right to retain passports and documents until a full payment is received. Depending on how many business days are available to order the service, the fees of our service may change. Holidays and consulate closings are not included.
                        Where an Vietnam Electronic Visa has been requested, the fee paid to Immigration Corp includes processing of the EVisa only and does not include any appeals or additional services. The cost of the EVisa application is non-refundable and should your application be refused you will not be issued a refund.
                        Once the application has been submitted to the appropriate government agency, the full fees will apply.

If any provision of these Terms does not comply with any law, then the provision must be read down so as to give it as much effect as possible. If it is not possible to give the provision any effect at all, then it must be treated as severable from the rest of the Terms. Where Visa@vietnam-evisa  is unable to carry out any obligation under the contract due to any circumstance, matter or thing beyond its reasonable control (“force majeure”) Visa@vietnam-evisa  shall be excused from such obligations to the extent of such prevention, restriction or interference so caused. Visa@vietnam-evisa  may subcontract all or part of its obligations or assign all or part of its rights under this contract. This agreement does not create any right enforceable by a person who is not a party to it, except for any lawful successor or assignee. Any dispute arising under this agreement shall be governed by Vietnam Law and both parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Vietnam.
